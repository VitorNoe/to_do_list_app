Before beginning the installation process, ensure your system meets the following requirements for optimal performance and compatibility.

### Development Environment
Your development machine should have adequate resources to run Flutter development tools efficiently. A minimum of 8GB RAM is recommended, with 16GB being ideal for smooth development experience. You will need at least 10GB of free disk space for the Flutter SDK, Android Studio, and project dependencies.

### Operating System Support
The Flutter Task Manager supports development on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. For Windows development, you need Windows 10 or later with Windows PowerShell 5.0 or newer. macOS users should have macOS 10.14 (Mojave) or later, while Linux users need a 64-bit distribution that supports snap packages.

### Target Platform Requirements
For Android deployment, the application supports devices running Android 5.0 (API level 21) or higher. This covers approximately 95% of active Android devices worldwide. For Windows deployment, the application requires Windows 10 version 1903 or later, ensuring compatibility with modern Windows systems.

## Flutter SDK Installation

The Flutter SDK is the foundation of your development environment and must be properly configured before proceeding with the application setup.

### Download and Setup
Visit the official Flutter website at flutter.dev and download the latest stable release of the Flutter SDK. Extract the downloaded archive to a location on your system where you have write permissions. Avoid placing Flutter in directories that require elevated privileges, such as Program Files on Windows.

### Environment Configuration
Add the Flutter bin directory to your system PATH environment variable. This allows you to run Flutter commands from any terminal or command prompt window. On Windows, you can edit the PATH through System Properties > Advanced > Environment Variables. On macOS and Linux, add the export command to your shell profile file (.bashrc, .zshrc, or similar).

### Verification
Open a new terminal or command prompt and run `flutter doctor` to verify your installation. This command checks your environment and displays a report of the status of your Flutter installation. Address any issues identified by the doctor command before proceeding.

## Development Tools Setup

Proper development tools significantly enhance your productivity and debugging capabilities when working with the Flutter Task Manager.

### Android Studio Installation
Download and install Android Studio from the official website. During installation, ensure you select the Android SDK, Android SDK Platform-Tools, and Android SDK Build-Tools. These components are essential for Android development and debugging.

### Flutter Plugin Configuration
In Android Studio, navigate to File > Settings > Plugins (or Android Studio > Preferences > Plugins on macOS). Search for and install the Flutter plugin, which will automatically install the Dart plugin as a dependency. Restart Android Studio after plugin installation.

### SDK Configuration
Open Android Studio and navigate to Tools > SDK Manager. Ensure you have at least one Android SDK platform installed (Android 10.0 API level 29 or higher is recommended). Also verify that the Android SDK Build-Tools and Android Emulator are installed and up to date.

### Device Setup
For physical device testing, enable Developer Options and USB Debugging on your Android device. Connect the device via USB and authorize the debugging connection when prompted. For Windows testing, ensure your development machine meets the Windows app development requirements.

## Project Setup and Dependencies

With your development environment configured, you can now set up the Flutter Task Manager project and install its dependencies.

### Project Acquisition
Clone or download the Flutter Task Manager project to your local development machine. If using Git, run `git clone <repository-url>` in your desired directory. Alternatively, download the project as a ZIP file and extract it to your chosen location.

### Dependency Installation
Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal or command prompt. Run `flutter pub get` to download and install all required dependencies. This process may take several minutes depending on your internet connection speed and the number of dependencies.

### Dependency Verification
The project uses several key dependencies that enhance functionality and user experience. The sqflite package provides SQLite database capabilities for local data storage. Provider manages application state efficiently across the widget tree. Google Fonts delivers beautiful typography, while flutter_staggered_animations creates smooth, engaging user interface transitions.

## Database Configuration

The Flutter Task Manager uses SQLite for local data persistence, requiring no additional database server setup or configuration.

### Automatic Database Creation
The application automatically creates and configures the SQLite database on first launch. The database schema includes a tasks table with fields for task identification, content, completion status, timestamps, categories, and priority levels. No manual database setup is required.

### Data Storage Location
On Android devices, the database is stored in the application's private data directory, ensuring data security and preventing unauthorized access. On Windows, the database is located in the application's local data folder within the user's profile directory.

### Migration Handling
The database helper class includes version management and migration capabilities for future schema updates. This ensures smooth application updates without data loss when new features require database modifications.

## Running the Application

Once your environment is configured and dependencies are installed, you can run the Flutter Task Manager on your target platforms.

### Development Mode
For development and testing, use `flutter run` in the project directory. This command builds and launches the application in debug mode, enabling hot reload functionality for rapid development iteration. The debug mode includes additional logging and debugging information.

### Platform Selection
To run on a specific platform, use the `-d` flag followed by the device identifier. For Android emulator or connected device, use `flutter run -d android`. For Windows desktop, use `flutter run -d windows`. You can list available devices with `flutter devices`.

### Hot Reload
During development, take advantage of Flutter's hot reload feature by pressing 'r' in the terminal after making code changes. This instantly updates the running application without losing the current state, significantly speeding up the development process.

## Building for Production

When ready to distribute your application, create optimized production builds for your target platforms.

### Android APK Build
Generate a release APK for Android distribution using `flutter build apk --release`. This creates an optimized, signed APK file in the build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/ directory. The release build is significantly smaller and faster than debug builds.

### Windows Executable Build
Create a Windows executable using `flutter build windows --release`. This generates a complete Windows application package in the build/windows/runner/Release/ directory, including all necessary runtime files and dependencies.

### Build Optimization
Release builds automatically include code optimization, tree shaking to remove unused code, and asset compression to minimize application size. The resulting applications are production-ready and suitable for distribution to end users.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

Address common installation and setup issues that may arise during the development environment configuration.

### Flutter Doctor Issues
If `flutter doctor` reports issues, carefully read the provided guidance for resolution. Common issues include missing Android SDK components, outdated tools, or incorrect PATH configuration. Follow the specific instructions provided for each identified problem.

### Dependency Conflicts
If you encounter dependency version conflicts during `flutter pub get`, check the pubspec.yaml file for version constraints. Sometimes clearing the pub cache with `flutter pub cache repair` resolves persistent dependency issues.

### Platform-Specific Problems
For Android-specific issues, verify that your Android SDK is properly configured and up to date. Ensure USB debugging is enabled on physical devices and that emulators have sufficient allocated memory. For Windows issues, confirm that Windows development tools are properly installed and configured.

### Performance Optimization
If you experience slow build times or runtime performance issues, consider increasing available memory for the Dart VM using the `--dart-vm-options` flag. Additionally, ensure your development machine has adequate resources and that antivirus software is not interfering with Flutter operations.

## Next Steps

With the Flutter Task Manager successfully installed and running, you can begin exploring its features and customizing it for your specific needs.

### Feature Exploration
Start by creating your first task to familiarize yourself with the application's interface and functionality. Experiment with different categories, priority levels, and filtering options to understand the full scope of available features.

### Customization Opportunities
The application's modular architecture makes it easy to customize colors, themes, and functionality. Consider modifying the app theme in the utils/app_theme.dart file to match your preferred color scheme or branding requirements.

### Development Continuation
If you plan to extend the application with additional features, review the project structure and architecture documentation. The clean separation of concerns and well-documented codebase facilitate easy feature additions and modifications.

This installation guide provides a comprehensive foundation for setting up and running the Flutter Task Manager. Following these steps ensures a smooth development experience and successful application deployment across supported platforms.
